# Pocket Photo Log

> A photo log CMS built on PocketBase and Astro.

## Why this exists

I was looking for a way to migrate my photo log from a hosted platform (tumblr, flickr, instagram) to a self-hosted solution.

All available options are either too bloated (Wordpress), not suited for photography (Ghost) or just seem too complex (headless CMS + custom frontend) for the task at hand.

So this is my solution for my problem.

The goal is to make the software usable by anyone who wishes to self-host, via images and docker compose.

## Current state

The project is on it's way to a v1 but there are still a few things to do before that.

- [x] Add admin interface to change settings.
- [x] Add photo sets feature
- [ ] Create backend deployment docker image
- [ ] Improve rendered image quality
- [x] Process image on upload (size & metadata)
